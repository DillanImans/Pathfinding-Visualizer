### Project Desc
A Pathfinding Visualizer for Pathfinding-Algorithms (currently only Dijkstra)

----
### Project Characteristics
* Made with React & Redux.
* Pathfinding Algorithms include: Dijkstra.
* Comments on Algorithms, hence an explanation for how everything works.
----
### Project Weaknesses
* Only available for Desktop.
* Certain styling and functions could be made better.
----
### Future Updates
No plan on any updates.

### Personal Importance
I've always wanted to make a Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer, and here I finally have!
Inspired by Clement Mihalescu, making this whole thing 
led me to learn a few things such as: how amazing React & Redux is,
how object and properties are crucial to software development, and how beautiful
the world of computer science is with all their theories and implemantations.
Looking forward to put more and more into this project!

----
### Note
Certain parts of the code is very similar to the one used by Clement Mihalescu, and that is
on purpose due to where I've learned where to make this project from. I plan to improve
on the foundations here.
